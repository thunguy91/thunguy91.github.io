<h2>Hi there!</h2>

<p>I'm Thu Nguyen and welcome to my portfolio! I'm an entry level software developer passionate about creating clean, intuitive, and user-friendly web experiences. Through coursework and real-world projects, I've built responsive applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and also have experience with Java, SQL, and Spring. I enjoy tackling challenging problems, breaking down requirements, and finding thoughtful technical solutions.</p>

<p>I am looking for entry level or junior developer roles where I can continue learning, collaborate with talented teams, and contribute to building meaningful, user-focused projects.</p>
