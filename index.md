<h3><b>Hi there!</b> </h3>

<p> 
I'm Thu Nguyen and welcome to my portfolio! I'm an entry level software developer passionate about creating clean, intuitive, and user-friendly web experiences. Through coursework and real-world projects, I've built responsive applications using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>React</b>, and also have experience with <b>Java</b>, <b>SQL</b>, and <b>Spring</b>. I enjoy tackling challenging problems, breaking down requirements, and finding thoughtful technical solutions.
</p>

<p> 
I am looking for entry level or junior developer roles where I can continue learning, collaborate with talented teams, and contribute to building meaningful, user-focused projects.
